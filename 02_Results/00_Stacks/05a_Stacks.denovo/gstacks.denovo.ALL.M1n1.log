Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 1169312 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  72393 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (6.2%);
  For the remaining 1096919 loci (93.8%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 169.4 bp;
  418892 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (38.2%)
    Mean overlap: 27.3bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 135.2;
  Out of 2074753236 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 1869.1 reads per locus),
    2050216380 were successfuly aligned (98.8%);
  Mean insert length was 131.4, stdev: 25.7 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 1095723 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=16.2x, stdev=7.6x, min=5.3x, max=42.9x
  mean number of sites per locus: 163.4
  a consistent phasing was found for 3706808 of out 5928018 (62.5%) diploid loci needing phasing

gstacks is done.
