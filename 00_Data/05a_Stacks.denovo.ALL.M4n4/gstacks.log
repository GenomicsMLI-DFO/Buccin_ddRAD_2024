Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 685405 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  56472 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (8.2%);
  For the remaining 628933 loci (91.8%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 170.5 bp;
  235240 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (37.4%)
    Mean overlap: 27.3bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 135.9;
  Out of 1600856350 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 2506.8 reads per locus),
    1576635362 were successfuly aligned (98.5%);
  Mean insert length was 131.8, stdev: 27.1 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 628229 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=16.2x, stdev=7.5x, min=3.0x, max=43.3x
  mean number of sites per locus: 164.4
  a consistent phasing was found for 3573475 of out 5503914 (64.9%) diploid loci needing phasing
