Read 229293036 BAM records:
  kept 7335621 primary alignments (3.2%), of which 3435031 reverse reads
  skipped 33065890 primary alignments with insufficient mapping qualities (14.5%)
  skipped 27537545 excessively soft-clipped primary alignments (12.0%)
  skipped 160732410 unmapped reads (70.3%)
  skipped some suboptimal (secondary/supplementary) alignment records

  Per-sample stats (details in 'gstacks.log.distribs'):
    read 7165407.4 records/sample (28-20108598)
    kept 1.6%-4.3% of these

Built 7249 loci comprising 3900590 forward reads and 2458436 matching paired-end reads; mean insert length was 127.9 (sd: 24.1).

Genotyped 7249 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=-nanx, stdev=-nanx, min=3.5x, max=234.0x
  mean number of sites per locus: 99.3
  a consistent phasing was found for 2761 of out 4736 (58.3%) diploid loci needing phasing
