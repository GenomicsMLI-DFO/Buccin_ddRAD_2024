Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 1023765 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  77758 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (7.6%);
  For the remaining 946007 loci (92.4%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 173.5 bp;
  305661 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (32.3%)
    Mean overlap: 26.7bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 138.3;
  Out of 2046467502 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 2137.5 reads per locus),
    2022056144 were successfuly aligned (98.8%);
  Mean insert length was 131.2, stdev: 25.6 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 944612 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=16.2x, stdev=7.5x, min=3.5x, max=42.9x
  mean number of sites per locus: 166.9
  a consistent phasing was found for 3740857 of out 5967161 (62.7%) diploid loci needing phasing
